This is the git repository containing exercises for my presentation

# Instructions

Testify.html contains the spinning cube of unit testing.  The results of your tests will show up here.  Click and drag to rotate the cube and find the tests you're looking for along your adventure for knowledge!

If you're interested in learning (a little) JavaScript, I've commented the code that runs the tests and split it into tests.js and view.js.

The dataStructures and algorithms folders contain .js files with constructor functions for various data structures and algorithms.  There's an explanation at the top of the file for each of them, prototype function declarations that are meant for you to complete in the middle, and the tests themselves are at the bottom.

I would suggest completing them in this order:

Data Structures:

Arrays.js
linkedList.js
BinarySearchTree.js
HashTable.js
Heap.js
AVLTree.js

Algorithms:

bubbleSort.js
mergeSort.js
quickSort.js
DFS.js
Dijkstras.js
