# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This is the git repository containing the exercises for my presentation

# Instructions

Testify.html contains the spinning cube of unit testing.  Open it in a browser and the results of your tests will show up there.  Click and drag to rotate the cube and find the tests you're looking for along your adventure for knowledge!  If you would like to disregard the cube, test results are also logged to the console.

If you're interested, I've commented the code that runs the tests and displays the results and split it into testify-tests.js and testify-view.js.

The dataStructures and algorithms folders contain .js files with constructor functions for various data structures and algorithms.  There's an explanation at the top of the file for each of them, prototype function declarations that are meant for you to complete in the middle, and the tests themselves are at the bottom.

If you don't know much JavaScript, don't worry!  The exercises here are only an additional resource for you to use.  Feel free to program in whatever language you like, but don't forget to test your code!

I would suggest completing them in this order:

## Data Structures:

arrays.js

linkedList.js

binarySearchTree.js

hashTable.js

heap.js

AVLTree.js

## Algorithms:

binarySearch.js

insertionSort.js

mergeSort.js

quickSort.js

DFS.js

BFS.js

graphs.js

Dijkstras.js
